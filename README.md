# 👋 Hi, I’m Vinícius
Hobbyist Developer & Hardware Enthusiast Turning "not-so-dumb" ideas into code, one project at a time.

# 📖 About Me
> I use this GitHub as a creative sandbox for my studies and personal experiments. I enjoy the process of building things from scratch, whether it's a software tool or a physical circuit board.

#### 🔍 Philosophy: I filter through many ideas, discarding the "dumb" ones until I find something worth building from the ground up.

#### 🛠️ Hardware: I occasionally design schematics and PCBs for small embedded projects when the software needs a physical home.

> Hopefully I'll understand my own code and turn the faulty ones into useful stuff,
> if I don't get too bored of it to the point of letting it go.
